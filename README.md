# Credit-Card-Approval-Prediction

In today's fast-paced world, financial institutions receive a multitude of credit card applications daily. The process of scrutinizing these applications, considering factors like income levels, loans, and credit reports, can be laborious and prone to errors. It can be automated using Machine learning.

I've developed an Automatic Credit Card Approval Predictor using advanced machine learning techniques in **Scikit-Learn**. The primary goal is to expedite the approval process while maintaining accuracy and precision. The project incorporates a comprehensive pipeline, from exploratory data analysis to model implementation with an **accuracy of 100%**.

This technical journey spans meticulous Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), diverse machine learning classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost), and crucial data preprocessing steps (data imputation, normalization, and segregation) and visualization using seaborn and matplotlib.
